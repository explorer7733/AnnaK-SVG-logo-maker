## Description

* My motivation was to create the SVG Logo Maker application by using Node.js.

* I learned the following:

1. How to create a command-line application that takes user input to generate a logo using Node.js and the dependencies.
2. How to run the tests using Jest.

## Installation

1. Use the command line to navigate the directory of the application
2. Clone this project repo to your computer
3. Install the dependcies "npm intsall"
4. Install Jest "npm install --save-dev jest"

## Usage

1. Invoke the application in the command line "node index.js"
2. Answer the series of questions
3. Based on the input, messasge will dispay that "Logo.svg generated successfuly!"

## Test

To run the test, insert "npm test" in the command line.
